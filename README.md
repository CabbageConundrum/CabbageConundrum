- 👋 Hi, I’m @CabbageConundrum, a Toronto based developer who builds the internet. I mostly work with Javascript and React.
- 👀 I’m interested in security, software development, internet networking and the general flow of information.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to bughunt, code in C++ and develop backend SQL. Also, French.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to learn more about computer security.
